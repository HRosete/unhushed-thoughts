Realigned. Here's to recovered dreams, new things, and to listened and answered prayers. 🥂

💐
I walked a mile with Pleasure;
She chatted all the way;
But left me none the wiser
For all she had to say

I walked a mile with Sorrow,
And ne’er a word said she;
But, oh! The things I learned from her.
When Sorrow walked with me

– Robert Browning Hamilton

What a great way to cap off the first month of 2022! 🥳

It was an honor to be chosen as one of the speakers for Institute of Electronics Engineers of the Philippines (IECEP) - Central Philippine University (CPU) student chapter. I'm really grateful that I got to share the learnings I had in the industry -- technical, social, emotional, and mental. I imparted the things that they'll probably first encounter while transitioning from the academe to the engineering corporate world. I pray that it gave them insight and somehow prepared them for their chosen profession.

The future's bright for you, future Centralian Electronics Engineers! ☀️ Padayon!

Thank you to Miss Dallie and Engr. Juicy Valdueza for reaching out to me. If you only knew that it really is my pleasure. ❤

P.S. Crazy how God will surprise you, eh? When you thought that everything's going south, He'll push something in your way -- something that you have never ever imagined in your wildest dreams. I can think of a thousand reasons for Him to disqualify me, but it is true: God qualifies the called. This is His, not mine. Thank You, Lord!
