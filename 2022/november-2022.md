## november 1

In the name of the hustle and bustle culture, I quit.

It has been my "mantra" since the pandemic has started. Being overly-productive and rushed took a toll on my mental health. Right when the lockdown was implemented on March 15, 2020, I felt it and I knew I will be different once all of these chaos settles down.

It's November 1 and it's a holiday. It's raining outside and it just adds to the cozy slow mellow feel we have here on the inside. I like it like this: unrushed, no rigid schedules to follow, no deadlines to beat. Hot chocolate on one hand, still lounged in my jammies. Ah! this is the life! But the thought of "tomorrow is a workday" is lurking on the corner and it spoils the moment. Ugh, I dread it! It has been like this for quite some time and you might think that I should be used to this by now. Yeah, I should, but I'm not.

This headline from Manila Bulletin somehow explains and gives justice to what I'm feeling: [PH is most stressed, 2nd angriest, saddest country in Southeast Asia in 2021](https://mb.com.ph/2022/07/22/ph-is-most-stressed-2nd-angriest-saddest-country-in-southeast-asia-in-2021/). Yes, still true in 2022.
