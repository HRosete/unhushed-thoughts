In the name of the hustle and bustle culture, I quit.

It has been my "mantra" since the pandemic has started. Being overly-productive and rushed took a toll on my mental health. Right when the lockdown was implemented on March 15, 2020, I felt it and I knew I will be different once all of these chaos settles down.

It's November 1 and it's a holiday. It's raining outside and it just adds to the cozy slow mellow feel we have here on the inside. I like it like this: unrushed, no rigid schedules to follow, no deadlines to beat. Hot chocolate on one hand, still lounged in my jammies. Ah! this is the life! But the thought of "tomorrow is a workday" is lurking on the corner and it spoils the moment. Ugh, I dread it! It has been like this for quite some time and you might think that I should be used to this by now. Yeah, I should, but I'm not.

This headline from Manila Bulletin somehow explains and gives justice to what I'm feeling: [PH is most stressed, 2nd angriest, saddest country in Southeast Asia in 2021](https://mb.com.ph/2022/07/22/ph-is-most-stressed-2nd-angriest-saddest-country-in-southeast-asia-in-2021/). Yes, still true in 2022.

Watching a clip from Selena Gomez's documentary, My Mind and Me, makes me ponder. It's like I'm watching a part of my past through a televised scene from someone else's. 

Even without a psychologist, I can say for myself that I've went through depression. I know that it's not right to self-diagnose, but everyone around me can attest to that -- especially Ate Fil, Ate Tin, and Ate Divine from my Victory Group: they all witnessed my situation right from the day it ticked. Every single one of the symptoms of a depressed person, I had. I withdrew from people and I isolated. I cry out of nothing in the middle of the night. I can't sleep well at night for months on end because of my mind running full-engine with anxieties and what ifs and should've beens -- I have trouble getting to bed because of overthinking. There's this impending doom always hovering about my everyday. I detest waking up that I'll cry. I hyperventilated, I heard voices I thought were from two people conversing outside my room even if they weren't any. I was so tired all day, everyday, for months straight. Everyday mundane tasks were too hard for me to accomplish, I sometimes don't even take a bath! I regressed, I had tantrums, I reverted back as a little kid. I tried micromanaging everyone around me just so my sense of safety wouldn't be perturbed and if it did, my whole world crashes and I lash out out of fear and paranoia. Hopeless, everything was hopeless. Every single day for almost a year was tinged with grey and ash. I didn't want to live. I just about existed. 

And to think that I'm just barely scratching the surface of the hell I went through here on earth. Talking to a professional would just confirm all of our hunches and diagnose me with a clinical depression and maybe some more... 

A lot has happened between that and today, and I know I am still healing. I'm not fully-healed, I don't know when would I be. I am entirely sure that when my Lord Jesus comes back and brings me home, I will be. But for now that I am on this earth -- breathing, walking -- I am not certain if I'll be healed fully. I'm just taking it one day at a time.

I am bursting into tears.

It's not because something tragic happened, or my hormones are out of whack right now, or I'm just sad -- no no no, not at all. If there are a few things that can touch my heart and lead me to cry, one of them will be talking about Jesus Christ.

I am open about my faith in Christ -- always have, always have been, and always will be. It's one of the things I'm deeply passionate about and I can talk about Him for days on end. I won't be tired, I won't shy away. It's not because I follow Him blindly -- no! As a matter of fact, I challenged the faith I grew up in and asked God that if He truly is real -- if He is who He says He is, if He is the same God who graced Job His presence and answered all his queries -- and boy did He deliver: He is who He says He is and so much more! And my life is the receipt of our conversation. More on that articles down the road. Let's go back to what made me cry.

I now live in a world full of chaos and confusion -- a world wherein it's confused on what is left and right, a world so easily offended and doesn't easily forgive, and a world that can't describe what a woman truly is. You can be shamed for supporting one artist and cancelled if you hold a different stance with the majority. It's branding equality and open speech, but shuns people who gives their own piece of mind to the public. Young people are criticizing the older ones and call them "boomer" with such disgust and contempt while on the other hand, the older people bully the young ones and call them "entitled" and "ungrateful" even if most of them were the ones who raised this present modern generation. It's chaotic and messy! Sometimes you'll just sit down and wonder, how the heck did we go to this?

Hollywood, the land of the stars as I see it, is also a complicated place to uphold your values. People dance with the trends to stay up to date and still be relevant to the masses, especially the celebrities. What the majority wants, they do too. What the people hate, they boo too. Imagine if you are a follower of Christ and you share the same air as these people. I can only imagine how hard it would be to stand firm on the cross and maintain integrity (it won't be if their sole validation and identity is on the Lord and they're willing to lose it all for Him).

My heart swells with joy whenever I see celebrities stand their ground and profess their faith to Christ. I know how hard it is to say that when you're surrounded by sharks and piranhas. They're literally putting their entire career and fame on the line, risking to lose their fanbase and relevance to Hollywood. Take Jim Caviezel for example. After portraying Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", Jim claimed that Hollywood rejected him and that that town is not welcoming to Christ at all. Accepting the main role in the movie all but ensured the death of his Hollywood career. That's the reason why I applaud A-listers and entertainers holding onto their faith to Jesus even if it means the death of their career.

Letitia Wright and Chris Pratt, Marvel's new Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy's Star-Lord, are downright open and comfortable with their faith. (To be continued...)
