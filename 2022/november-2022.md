In the name of the hustle and bustle culture, I quit.

It has been my "mantra" since the pandemic has started. Being overly-productive and rushed took a toll on my mental health. Right when the lockdown was implemented on March 15, 2020, I felt it and I knew I will be different once all of these chaos settles down.

It's November 1 and it's a holiday. It's raining outside and it just adds to the cozy slow mellow feel we have here on the inside. I like it like this: unrushed, no rigid schedules to follow, no deadlines to beat. Hot chocolate on one hand, still lounged in my jammies. Ah! this is the life! But the thought of "tomorrow is a workday" is lurking on the corner and it spoils the moment. Ugh, I dread it! It has been like this for quite some time and you might think that I should be used to this by now. Yeah, I should, but I'm not.

This headline from Manila Bulletin somehow explains and gives justice to what I'm feeling: [PH is most stressed, 2nd angriest, saddest country in Southeast Asia in 2021](https://mb.com.ph/2022/07/22/ph-is-most-stressed-2nd-angriest-saddest-country-in-southeast-asia-in-2021/). Yes, still true in 2022.

Watching a clip from Selena Gomez's documentary, My Mind and Me, makes me ponder. It's like I'm watching a part of my past through a televised scene from someone else's. 

Even without a psychologist, I can say for myself that I've went through depression. I know that it's not right to self-diagnose, but everyone around me can attest to that -- especially Ate Fil, Ate Tin, and Ate Divine from my Victory Group: they all witnessed my situation right from the day it ticked. Every single one of the symptoms of a depressed person, I had. I withdrew from people and I isolated. I cry out of nothing in the middle of the night. I can't sleep well at night for months on end because of my mind running full-engine with anxieties and what ifs and should've beens -- I have trouble getting to bed because of overthinking. There's this impending doom always hovering about my everyday. I detest waking up that I'll cry. I hyperventilated, I heard voices I thought were from two people conversing outside my room even if they weren't any. I was so tired all day, everyday, for months straight. Everyday mundane tasks were too hard for me to accomplish, I sometimes don't even take a bath! I regressed, I had tantrums, I reverted back as a little kid. I tried micromanaging everyone around me just so my sense of safety wouldn't be perturbed and if it did, my whole world crashes and I lash out out of fear and paranoia. Hopeless, everything was hopeless. Every single day for almost a year was tinged with grey and ash. I didn't want to live. I just about existed. 

And to think that I'm just barely scratching the surface of the hell I went through here on earth. Talking to a professional would just confirm all of our hunches and diagnose me with a clinical depression and maybe some more... 

A lot has happened between that and today, and I know I am still healing. I'm not fully-healed, I don't know when would I be. I am entirely sure that when my Lord Jesus comes back and brings me home, I will be. But for now that I am on this earth -- breathing, walking -- I am not certain if I'll be healed fully. I'm just taking it one day at a time.
