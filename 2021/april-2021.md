## april 27

You cannot let your fear hold you back from your destiny. You have to feel the fear and do it anyway.

Do it broke.

Do it scared.

Do it nervous.

Do it trembling.

Do it on your knees.

Do it with help.

Do it on crutches.

Do it on a wheelchair.

Because you don't want to end up in a nursing home, seating on a bedpan wondering what would have happened if you only had more courage.

You don't want to end up in an old folks home and your dying thought is "I wish I had."

Because the one thing that you will never get is more time. So you don't have time to allow your fear to incarcerate you when you have the key. Reach around and unlock the door and step into your destiny.
