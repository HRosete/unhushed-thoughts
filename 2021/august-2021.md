What a ride it had been!
(Long post ahead)

I'm so grateful to the program organizers and to the Paper and Demo committees for choosing us as one of the presenters for ADTS 2021. You have given us a great opportunity, thank you. üíï

Most of all, I thank God. Ni di ko alam kung naging pangarap ko to noon. Maybe I did, but eventually I threw it away. I looked to myself, listened to the lies in my head, and agreed that I don't have it in me to make it. But God has His own ways of redeeming us.

Three Sundays ago, I shared to our Victory Group a piece entitled "The King, The Wait, and The Dream." It is based on the life of Joseph the Dreamer and how God humbled him and made him wait before making his dream a reality, his blessing.

I relate with Joseph the Dreamer this season.

In this piece, I recalled how God aligned my heart, mind, motives, and dreams to His these past couple of years. I thought wala na, hindi yun ang gusto ni God. Brinaso ko lang. Tinapon ko lahat ng plans ko in every area of my life thinking they were all trash. And I went with the flow, saying if it's meant to be, it will be.

Now that I'm "kind of" here, I now understand why God did those. It's as if God asked me, "Are you willing to give up everything, even your well-thought plans and dreams to Me? Do you trust Me that I have your best interest in mind? Where's your identity rooted, my child? Come to Me, I am more than enough for you. I love you." ‚ù§

As Pastor Steven Furtick (@stevenfurtick ) said, this is just an "audition" for the next bigger role God has to give. For me, I'm seeing it as a "preparation."

Are we the best in our field? No, but we are hard workers. Do we know everything we are doing? No, but we are great learners. üíï I'm so happy to share this dream with these amazing people. I thank God that He hasn't given it sooner. If He had, I never would have had this opportunity to learn and collaborate with these people. If He had, my heart and motives would be selfish and wrong.

And slowly, He is giving me back my dreams from a different perspective. An exciting one!

I thank God for His timing. He never is too early, or too late either. His timing is just right. ‚ù§ üïô
