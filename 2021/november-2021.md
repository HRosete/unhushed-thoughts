People are always talking about either their mountain-highs or their valley-lows. Seldom will you hear someone talk about what's happening in between. The area between the valleys and the mountaintops are often neglected and brushed upon when someone's sharing their story. But this is where the uphill battle starts both literally and metaphorically. This is where the cries of desperation from the valley mix with the hope brought by the mere glimpse of the mountaintop. This is where sustenance is needed, where the boldness formed from the mire of the valley must be intentionally sparked every step of the way -- where that mere spark is almost too hard to grasp, too hard to find. 

The same goes with its dire counterpart: the downhill slope. It happens when you've been in the mountaintops for so long and you've been totally blinded. Along with the worldly wealth, status, position, views, and fame you amassed, you come tumbling down while trying to grapple them for support. You then wrap your head with thoughts like, "How did I get here," "Why do these things happen to me," and "This is unfair, I don't deserve this." You sought support and anchor from your abilities and possessions, but they never gave you one, leaving you bewildered, confused, and ultimately, utterly betrayed. 

Personally, I experienced the thrill of being atop, the terror in the downslide, and the hopelessness in the valley. My uphill battle is now in commence.

May you find peace, solace, and resolve wherever you are in your journey. ‚ù§
