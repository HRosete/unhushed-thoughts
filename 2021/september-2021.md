My beau and I had a convo yesterday that stirred my mind (NV): 

Him 👨🏼‍🦰: I know you love writing stuff. Where do you share it?
Me 👩🏻: Hmmm, sometimes I share them in IG. Sometimes I don't, I just write them in my journal or share them with my gals.
👨🏼‍🦰: (ponders for a while) Have you tried Wattpad? Write stuff with storylines, like that.
👩🏻: I don't fancy Wattpad just like I did in high school and college. And I don't write that anymore. I now write about my realizations, the handful of lessons I learned. More like a blog.
👨🏼‍🦰: Then why don't you do it in Instagram?
👩🏻: 👁👄👁 (*blink blink*) 

Yup, mmm hmm, that got me. 

It was August last year when I had the heart to share and be vulnerable, but honestly I haven't done it that much. All I shared were glimpses of what I've learned, what I've gone through, but never in full. I know that I don't have to share anything that makes me uncomfortable (and yes, for privacy reasons), but delaying my desire to write freely feels like capping my wings off. There's always something in my heart that isn't right. 

I shared with some of my friends that I'd love to write a book in the future. One friend said that it'd be a good passion project and I agree! Then the days turned into months and I haven't written anything yet -- on paper or even here in my phone's notes. I kept on brushing it aside for the things that have to be done at the moment. 

And if I'm being totally honest, I admit that those are just some of the many excuses I have in my head. 

What really are stopping me are my pride and fear.
"What would they think if I'll post this,"
"Oh no, I shared too much,"
"I posted a lot this month, I should stop," or
"I just posted yesterday/ two days ago/ last week, I wouldn't want their feed to be full of my posts, that'd be too annoying."
It's as if I needed anything from the outside world to start what's been brewing in my heart. It has been a struggle to me ever since I acknowledged these alongside my once-misplaced validation and perfectionism. But when I started to walk my journey seriously -- not alone, but with God -- I slowly healed; unlearning and relearning misguided behaviors and attitudes, and filling my mind with the truth.

This dilemma that I had that stirred up after talking to my man is just one of the hurdles I have to face while growing and healing. How would I grow if I won't do what's pressed deeply in my heart?
.
And as if I needed a much louder reminder, I had a videochat with a dear friend, an ate, last week. She shared that she's been reminded these past few days to be honest, to be vulnerable with herself and her relationship with God, then she remembered me. She recalls that I am vocal with sharing how vulnerability, when seen at a victorious perspective, can really free us. My ate, if you're reading this, yes, it reminded me too. 💕

How would I write a book if I'm not willing to share and be vulnerable? How about I start it with this post? A post this long happens when you don't write in a long time. 🥴 Got it, mmm hmm, point taken.
