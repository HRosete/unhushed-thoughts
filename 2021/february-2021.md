With face down, he asked, "Then how would you know if you've been completely healed?"

She glanced his way with memories of where she'd been and the process she went through came flooding back. She smiled and replied, "When you look back at those moments and share them not from a point of hurt, fear, anger, and defeat; but of love, peace, forgiveness, and victory."
