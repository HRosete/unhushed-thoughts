### Heal

Oh, to heal is a bliss!
A path oh so coveted,
but people always miss.
It's a faint hope glistening
to a lost heart wandering.
An end-of-the-tunnel beckoning
to a pained sojourner searching.

To heal -- to fully deeply heal,
to mend a once red-hot heart
which became a cold-bluish teal --
is a journey less taken,
but one I really long to feel.

-- by yours truly ü§ç

"You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. Something hurts you, yet you know it shouldn't. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted.

"A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band. And most of us live somewhere in the middle.

"A wrestling match. Yes, you could describe life that way.

"Which side wins?

"Love wins. Love always wins."

I have always been reserved. Eventhough many know me as bubbly, madaldal, at mahilig makipag-usap sa kung sinu-sino, the truth is I really do value my privacy. I always keep track kung kanino ako nag-oopen-up, anong depth of details ang sineshare ko nang sa gayon, I know how I'll react or move around them. I value it so much na umabot sa point na I've become stoic, rigid-looking. Ni sa sarili ko di ko na fully maamin ang nararamdaman ko without justifying what I feel, what I do. In the process, marami akong namiss na opportunities to fully enjoy sweet moments with my friends. But instead of acknowledging it, I justified, yet again, thinking I am consoling myself.

The moment God asked me to be vulnerable is a real struggle, because I always thought vulnerability as a sign of weakness. What I've went through the past made me think of it. I wanted to resist, but at the back of my mind, I believe when God asked me to do something, it's always for my own good. My broken self believes that healing comes from obeying what God asked me to do. His ways are above my ways and His thoughts are so much higher than my thoughts. He is always for me and not against me, even if I can't understand what He's doing at the moment.

If in my weakness Jesus will be glorified, then let me boast on my weakness all the more.

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù Samuel said. ‚ÄúDoes the Lord really want sacrifices and offerings? No! He doesn't want your sacrifices. He wants you to obey him. - 1 Samuel 15:22 CEV

Three times I did that, and then he told me, My grace is enough; it‚Äôs all you need. My strength comes into its own in your weakness. Once I heard that, I was glad to let it happen. I quit focusing on the handicap and began appreciating the gift. It was a case of Christ‚Äôs strength moving in on my weakness. Now I take limitations in stride, and with good cheer, these limitations that cut me down to size‚Äîabuse, accidents, opposition, bad breaks. I just let Christ take over! And so the weaker I get, the stronger I become. - 2 Corinthians 12:8-10 MSG
