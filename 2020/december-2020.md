Christmas is indeed different this year. Ito ang Pasko ng mga firsts for me:

1. First Christmas na nagcelebrate ako without any of my blood relatives.
2. First Christmas na ako mismo ang nagluto ng handa (isang putahe) -- good for six! 😱
3. First Christmas that I felt the holiday blues -- being away from the family and all. 💙 It can be seen on how I act and I can't help it. 😔

However, I wouldn't have it any other way. Yes, I miss my family, but on the other hand, I gained another one. 🥰

This year 2020 is a wild ride. Hindi ko inexpect na pati holiday season niya ganun din. But here we are. ❤

I still remember when I got my verse for the year of 2020. I got an affirmation from a photo Kenneth sent me from Malaysia, a backdrop of a church's yearend party. It has Isaiah 43:18-19. It said, "Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert." And boy did God made it to a reality. Many things He changed, most of them inside me. Took many prunings and cries and rejoices. It gave a whole lot of color and facets to what God's abundant grace is.

Just when I think I'll have the holiday off, He checked my heart by giving me this verse. That's when I knew my heart was slowly anchored to other than Him. But it was God's grace that ushered me to that realization. And I believe the whole year will be just like that. He will continue His promise the year prior while ushering me to know He who is greater than I, anchoring my trust and faith to Jesus alone. And to know how awesome is the God I serve. 

Happy hopeful new year! #AwesomeGod2021

On these crossroads I bid 2020 goodbye, thanking it for the lessons I learned and the transformation it started in me. It may be the hardest year we've had, but hey, we won't know our best assets if we're not put under the test, right?

And in here I walked into 2021, hopeful -- and a bit terrified and overwhelmed, if I may be honest -- for what God has in store for me.

May you all have a hopeful new year. May we have an unquenchable living hope that yearns for the better, anchored on the Truth. 🥀
