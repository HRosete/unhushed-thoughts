I like how nature soothes and calms my mind, the sense of serenity it gives, unlike these concrete jungles we're in. Here, everything seems to be slow and sure. At peace. Silent. Forgiving. Open. I'd gladly go back here in a heartbeat, especially nowadays.

I'm forever thankful to this man (last pic) for putting up with me for years. He knows what to do when I'm mad, anxious, and overwhelmed - he just keeps silent. He lets me be. He's patient. More patient than what can I ever deserve and hope for. As the years went by, we grew, we learned new things. We laughed, we cried, we hugged, and boy we clashed. Yet he grew more and more patient and a bit more understanding. His silence has become a gift. The one gift I never knew I'd be happy to receive.

You're my piece of nature within these concrete walls around us. I'm forever thankful to God for you. Te amo. ‚ù§

Times like this need drastic measures: prayer should be our first line of defense, not last.  If the problem's big, then it's big enough to pray about. I just find it comforting to know that Paul, too, experienced this and he asked the church in Corinth to help them through prayer. It's not about how fancy our prayer is, it's about the One on the other end Who hears our prayer. No prayer is lame if you know the great God you're praying to.

There's no time for apathy. Pray for a brother or sister, pray with one another.
