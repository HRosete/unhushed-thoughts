## 8 January

A week into the new year has passed, and the vigor that a new year brings still lingers in the air. People back home still seem to be motivated, and everyone is still crushing their fitness goals. I, for one, am feisty, bringing in "planning" this year -- something that I haven't done before -- alongside prayer and fasting. I have been fasting at the start of the year since 2018, and it is a tradition that has stuck with me since I started getting serious about my faith in God. It has served me well, not just mentally, but also spiritually. It helped me lay down my goals to God, have His say over them, and modify them according to what He wills. I then obediently follow it. It was not easy doing it in the early years, but because I now know Him more, it is easier.

I was optimistic and hopeful about this year -- 2025. If you ask me, I cannot point out a reason that makes this year special. Although I looked forward to this year as the "golden" one, it brought with it sad news. Lola Zenia, Lola Zenaida's sister, has died at 86 years old. It was so sudden; I was in shock. Grief visited me the next morning, and tears streamed down my eyes as I sobbed upon the realization of the news. No one saw it coming -- yes, even at her old age, since her peers are still rocking at 91. I still hang on to that glimmer of hope, though, that God will still push through this year.
