## 8 January

A week into the new year has passed, and the vigor that a new year brings still lingers in the air. People back home still seem to be motivated, and everyone is still crushing their fitness goals. I, for one, am feisty, bringing in "planning" this year -- something that I haven't done before -- alongside prayer and fasting. I have been fasting at the start of the year since 2018, and it is a tradition that has stuck with me since I started getting serious about my faith in God. It has served me well, not just mentally, but also spiritually. It helped me lay down my goals to God, have His say over them, and modify them according to what He wills. I then obediently follow it. It was not easy doing it in the early years, but because I now know Him more, it is easier.

I was optimistic and hopeful about this year -- 2025. If you ask me, I cannot point out a reason that makes this year special. Although I looked forward to this year as the "golden" one, it brought with it sad news. Lola Zenia, Lola Zenaida's sister, has died at 86 years old. It was so sudden; I was in shock. Grief visited me the next morning, and tears streamed down my eyes as I sobbed upon the realization of the news. No one saw it coming -- yes, even at her old age, since her peers are still rocking at 91. I still hang on to that glimmer of hope, though, that God will still push through this year.


## 13 January

I now remember the title of the first proper book I read when I was a kid: The Witches by Roald Dahl.

I clearly remembered where I was sitting trying to read the book a childhood friend lent me. I was sitting on a chair near the threshold of the photocopying shop my mama once used to work at. I quickly hurried to her after my classes were finished, eager to finish my first book. It is still etched in my brain how different it was compared to the "Scitech" magazines mama urges me to read every summer. "Wow, okay, this is different. How should I read this?" my mind asks as I fumble across the pages of the book, not knowing how to process fiction books.

I tried remembering the title for years, but I failed. Not until recently when my dear husband brought me home two books, one of which was Roald Dahl's Going Solo. I dug into it thinking it was the first Roald Dahl book I had read in my entire life. However, curiosity got ahead of me, and Dahl's life became interesting to me. I searched about his life on Google and peered through all the books he had made. One by one I scoured them until I stumbled upon "The Witches." It couldn't be the same book, could it? Onto the reviews I went and scanned, "There's a movie made after it." I switched to YouTube, typed "The Witches movie trailer," and posed on the thumbnail is the gorgeous Anne Hathaway. I finished the trailer saying, "Oooh! The plot seems familiar!" Familiar it really was because it was the exact same book I read as a child. My hunch was sealed when I read this comment in its comment section:

"Remember the older film where a witch trapped a girl in a painting and her family watched her age in the painting but never saw her move and then eventually she disappeared from (sic) it 'cause she died? That shit still scares me."

Yep, it is the exact same book. Cruel magic and all.
