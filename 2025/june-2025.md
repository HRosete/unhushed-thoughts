## 11 June

What a week it has been! I worked during my birthday, celebrated it two days after, and just yesterday, I learned that it was supposed to be Annette's last day! How the events escalated quickly! She cleared to me and Irina that she will still be staying for a month because apparently, the HR informed her that she has used up all of her annual leaves. If she'll insist on leaving three weeks before her actual last day which is on the 2nd of Jule (I suppose), her severance pay of A$135k will be taxed with A$20k.
