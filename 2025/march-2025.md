If not now, then when?

Yes, that's a great question. When? When is the "right" time to act upon what God has put in your heart? You are always waiting for the perfect timing, but when is "perfect"? When is the right time to publish a book? When is the right time to create thought-provoking videos? When is the perfect time to publish your thoughts, your questions, your musings, your story? What is holding you back? Perhaps the better question is, what are you afraid of?

God has given your voice back. He is with you. Don't be afraid; His is the only validation you need. ❤️ Only He can satisfy; only He, the Vine, can make things flourish. He only has your best interest at heart.

Don't be afraid. Let go.

The desire to publish a book has long been planted in my heart. From what I can remember, I was in fifth grade when I attempted to make one. It was going to be about "Tips for Life," and I had already scrawled the title page. I wrote the letters vertically downward, and I wrote the same thing horizontally where the two both share the same "O." "It's perfect," I said, the two sets of titles hinging in the middle -- I reasoned that because "Tips" and "Life" have the same number of letters, intersecting the two sets at "O" is perfection, a chef's kiss. I vividly remember it was written in black ink on a Cattleya notebook my mama had allowed me to buy. As I stopped and stared at my title page, I pondered how I could write about tips on living your best life when I myself, the author, ten years of age back then, had a lot more living and growing up to do. I quickly tore the page down and put the idea on hold, thinking it was so silly of me to write one. Not now, I said, but maybe in the future, I guess?

Unbeknownst to me, the desire would resurface some fourteen years after it was first conceived.

The year was 2020, and the world came to a halt. No one expected this to happen in their lifetime—a pandemic and the worldwide economy on the brink of recession; this stuff was the kind of story you hear your grandparents, great-grandparents even, retell annually at the dinner table during reunions. Nobody could believe it; it was like a fever dream.

While the world was in a fever dream, I was fighting life-and-death battles in my room. While everyone was going crazy over TikTok dances and Dalgona coffees, I was plunged straight into hell, screaming, where the noise from the outside drowned my shrieks among the excited glees.

Now, as I am still learning how to walk after I emerged here on the other side, the desire to write beats unmistakably louder. It probably would still contain "Tips for Life," just like my ten-year-old self hoped to, but just a little different—built on a different foundation with a more heartfelt intention. The plan was not to rack up followers for myself, for who am I but a person just like you, formed beautifully with traces of mess and glee? I would rather point people to the Cure of this mess we're in, greatly Victorious. The One who hasn't shied away from pain and death, but because of love, fully embraced it. The One who did the impossible—rose up on the third day, shattering the chains of darkness once and for all, enabling us to triumph and not be conquered on this side of eternity.

C. S. Lewis nicknamed him "Aslan," and J.R.R. Tolkien embodied him as "Gandalf." If his allegories are similarly wonderful, how much more is he, the Truth? He is none other than Jesus, the Christ.
