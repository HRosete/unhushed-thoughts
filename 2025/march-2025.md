If not now, then when?

Yes, that's a great question. When? When is the "right" time to act upon what God has put in your heart? You are always waiting for the perfect timing, but when is "perfect"? When is the right time to publish a book? When is the right time to create thought-provoking videos? When is the perfect time to publish your thoughts, your questions, your musings, your story? What is holding you back? Perhaps the better question is, what are you afraid of?

God has given your voice back. He is with you. Don't be afraid; His is the only validation you need. ❤️ Only He can satisfy; only He, the Vine, can make things flourish. He only has your best interest at heart.

Don't be afraid. Let go.

The desire to publish a book has long been planted in my heart. From what I can remember, I was in fifth grade when I attempted to make one. It was going to be about "Tips for Life," and I had already scrawled the title page. I wrote the letters vertically downward, and I wrote the same thing horizontally where the two both share the same "O." "It's perfect," I said, the two sets of titles hinging in the middle -- I reasoned that because "Tips" and "Life" have the same number of letters, intersecting the two sets at "O" is perfection, a chef's kiss. I vividly remember it was written in black ink on a Cattleya notebook my mama had allowed me to buy. As I stopped and stared at my title page, I pondered how I could write about tips on living your best life when I myself, the author, ten years of age back then, had a lot more living and growing up to do. I quickly tore the page down and put the idea on hold, thinking it was so silly of me to write one. Not now, I said, but maybe in the future, I guess?

Unbeknownst to me, the desire would resurface some fourteen years after it was first conceived.

The year was 2020, and the world came to a halt. No one expected this to happen in their lifetime—a pandemic and the worldwide economy on the brink of recession; this stuff was the kind of story you hear your grandparents, great-grandparents even, retell annually at the dinner table during reunions. Nobody could believe it; it was like a fever dream.

While the world was in a fever dream, I was fighting life-and-death battles in my room. While everyone was going crazy over TikTok dances and Dalgona coffees, I was plunged straight into hell, screaming, where the noise from the outside drowned my shrieks among the excited glees.

Now, as I am still learning how to walk after I emerged here on the other side, the desire to write beats unmistakably louder. It probably would still contain "Tips for Life," just like my ten-year-old self hoped to, but just a little different—built on a different foundation with a more heartfelt intention. The plan was not to rack up followers for myself, for who am I but a person just like you, formed beautifully with traces of mess and glee? I would rather point people to the Cure of this mess we're in, greatly Victorious. The One who hasn't shied away from pain and death, but because of love, fully embraced it. The One who did the impossible—rose up on the third day, shattering the chains of darkness once and for all, enabling us to triumph and not be conquered on this side of eternity.

C. S. Lewis nicknamed him "Aslan," and J.R.R. Tolkien embodied him as "Gandalf." If his allegories are similarly wonderful, how much more is he, the Truth? He is none other than Jesus, the Christ.

Only when you lose things will you appreciate them.

Working at a professional job right after college made me blind to how blessed I was. I had no previous work experience except for the time I spent as a Math and Physics tutor in college. I sort of had it all by our culture's standards. If I may say, I was brought up as a "golden child"—a high academic achiever with a stable-looking job. I had it; I was on top of the world, as others would see it.

But I failed to see what they saw.

I wallowed in defeat, crying on my bed, letting the unfair treatment of the world get the best of me. I may be a young woman on the outside, but deep inside, I was still a young kid dealing with how to cope with a scraped knee in the playground of the real world. A quick disclaimer: I am in no way shaming my old self; I believe I wandered through life with the best of the knowledge I had back then. What I experienced was real and was a reality in a dysfunctional workplace. It is unfair for my current self to judge my old self, knowing that I did not have the knowledge and experience I have now back then. However, if I had, I would have been more grateful.

Fast forward to today, and I am now here in Sydney, Australia, with my husband, employed in jobs that pay more but lack purpose and career paths.

...

Thank You, Lord Jesus, for catching me and helping me subject my thoughts to You. A few moments earlier, I broke down crying after re-reading what I just wrote and fully realizing what happened to me in the past five years. The reality just dawned on me, and I sobbed uncontrollably. Only when I called upon the name of the Lord and calmed down did I see how blessed I actually am. I almost got sucked into the cycle of making myself the victim of my circumstances. Thank You, Lord, for teaching me how to have a grateful heart in all circumstances, for teaching me how to see the world from a different perspective, and to gauge every moment against the bird's-eye view, which is Your plan for my life. Lord, my heart swells in gratitude for letting us come here to Sydney to start anew with You. Not everyone is blessed to have this opportunity, and for You to offer it to us is an honor. I now don't mind starting from the bottom again if it means starting it with You. Thank You for not letting me be a victim of my circumstances, but reminding me that I am victorious in You, Christ Jesus. As You have led Abraham, You will lead me and my husband. I pray to have the obedience of Abraham, the heart's desire to follow You as David did, and gratitude amidst any circumstance as Job did. Thank You for letting me grieve, and thank You for giving me a different lens to look through. Remind me that nothing is ever a waste for You and everything has its own place and time; all You just need from me is to believe with my whole heart and have faith in who You are. You are unchanging - You are the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow - and You are ever faithful.
