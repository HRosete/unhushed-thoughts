**The Girl I Was, The Woman I Am**

I can’t help but feel nostalgic and long for things that have been. I find myself grieving for the past, wishing them as though they are the present. How different my world has now been—a stark contrast to what I had ten years ago. A part of me wants to go back on that fateful time with the newfound carefree nature that I have today, and bask in the moments with friends and loved ones. How different my relationships would be! Alas, I can only imagine.

I cannot bring myself to blame my past self nor my circumstances—I dealt with the cards I had back then to the best of my narrow abilities. Dark may they be, but that was how I perceived the world, and to me, it was light even when it’s not. It took a slow and steady shaking in order for the scales on my eyes to fall loose. It may have taken me longer than I should have wanted, but it’s better late than never. A part of me will always mourn for the have-beens, could-haves and what-ifs; but if not for those, I wouldn’t be the woman I am today.
