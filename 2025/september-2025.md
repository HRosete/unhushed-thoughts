### Charlie Kirk

How ironic this day has been. Every second Thursday of September is celebrated as R U OK? Day in Australia. Never would I have imagined that Ken and I would be asking ourselves that to check how we are holding up to the assassination of a prominent Christian political figure: Charlie Kirk.

Never have I been more impacted by the death of a prominent figure, let alone a political activist. I was never drawn to that social area; however, these dark, confusing, and anxiety-ridden days got me thinking about it often. Charlie Kirk has been a beacon of light piercing through the darkness. He faced it head-on, engaging students in conversations they would often be afraid to talk about even with their peers for fear of division and misunderstanding. What sets Charlie apart is his deep and wholehearted faith in Jesus Christ, which he brings into every conversation, aligning his political views with Biblical standpoints. He advocates for Christ, first and foremost, eager to bring his beloved country back to Him one campus at a time.

The grim realization of the reality of the life we are called to in Christ dawned on me immediately upon hearing of Charlie Kirk's death. I cried knowing that I and modern Christians will have this death in the name of Jesus, and no one will be exempt. As hard a pill as it might be to swallow, it is one that has been foretold in the Bible. It is just unsettling to think that the martyrdom we hear of old is here right now on our doorsteps, and we will be walking the same path. But I'd rather die proclaiming Jesus Christ than live amicably with everyone here on Earth at the expense of having to renounce the Kingship and Lordship of Jesus Christ in my life.

I cannot be silent. I won't be silenced.

I do not hold the same courage Charlie had, and his rhetoric makes me challenge what I deem as true, inviting me to peek into perspectives different from mine. I do not agree with his stance on guns, but I remind myself that I haven't lived the reality he grew up with. I hadn't walked the streets he walked, nor talked with the people he encountered. Then who am I to nullify his stance? From what I’ve learned in 29 years of traversing this earth, I must hold a lot of space and grace for people I disagree with. They are real people who experienced life from circumstances polarly opposite to mine.

# To Charlie: #

I haven't met you in person and just pass by your clips from time to time in my feed, but my heart grieved at the news of your passing as if someone in my family had died. My husband and I were watching the news the moment you were shot, and we both prayed fervently for your miraculous healing. But alas, Jesus had another kind of healing in mind—an eternal one. I was distraught at work, so gut-wrenched I couldn't focus. I mourned as if I mourned for a brother I never had. That's when I went online and saw that all Christians felt the same way; the Holy Spirit mourned your loss, and all of us who have Him felt it mightily. Indeed, we really are one spiritual family, and you are my courageous brother in Christ.

As Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah's spirit when God took him up, I pray to Jesus to have half of the courage you had. I can't keep still—something in the air has shifted. I can't stop writing, and I won't be silenced. The fire in me has been awakened. I am ashamed to admit that it took your death for me to snap out of my fear, but I would do your sacrifice injustice if I kept my old ways and remained silent on the things Jesus proclaimed. But not anymore.

See you in the morning, my brother. Thank you. Please enjoy the streets of gold as you walk with Jesus side by side. I can only imagine the smile painted on your face because of how elated you are. Your loving wife and kids will always be in my prayers.
