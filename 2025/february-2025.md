"What the enemy meant for evil, God meant for good."

It has been well-known and open how I was hurt by my first manager and how that hurt led me into a spiral of victim mindset and trapped me there for years. Many times I have tried to reach out for help, but to no avail, not knowing some of the people I asked for help were as selfishly motivated themselves as my first manager. I spoke, and I became open, learning how to accurately get my message across professionally, hoping someone in their right mind would hear. I got the same sentiments horizontally, where others in the team felt the same way, yet they didn't have the gall and the guts to point it out. Some were just as frustrated as I was, even doing louder things than I did, hoping someone from upper management would listen and alter the course of the company culture. Sadly, none of them did. Instead, some even gaslighted us into thinking that way. It made me feel inadequate and dumb as an engineer, even questioning my presentation skills and the knowledge I garnered from working in the industry for five years. The impostor syndrome had a grip on me that I was even afraid to apply to other jobs. I vividly remember how hurt I was before, but thank God that's all I do now: remember and not feel.

After tendering my one-month notice, my husband and I flew to Australia to start anew. I studied for a master's degree in Project Management for two years while my husband worked in hospitality and I, casually, in the university. We are aiming to get the Permanent Visa through the General Skilled Migration...

I had the guts to speak out because at that time, I didn't have anything to lose.

Remember when I said that I can just remember and not feel in the first few paragraphs? I did not mean that I was numb, oh by no means I am one. God taught me how to let go and surrender this to Him. He gave me space, He gave me grace. He helped me heal. I thank Jesus Christ for what he has done on the cross because none of this would come to full fruition had it not been for his sacrifice. After a few years, I have been healed. I have also been validated and reinstated. All that because God helped me surrender.
