Two years ago, I have decided to work on myself and further my education. That meant leaving my job in tech and embrace the unknown in an otherwise precarious job market situation. Although I have bid goodbye to a few colleagues, I figured my farewell letter has fallen short a few words of gratitude that I eagerly wanted to convey.

Analog Devices, Inc., I truly am grateful for the formative five years of my career. Thank you for taking a shot on me during one of your University Caravans in the Philippines and took me as one of your Academe Linkage Scholars. Never would I have known that it would shape me in a way that I am now - always thinking strategically, open to diverse opinions, and excited for the possible future that tech is going to tread . It has been an honour to work alongside some of the brightest engineers in Silicon Valley and beyond. I've witnessed firsthand how they navigate complex decisions and breathe life into visionary ideasâ€”innovations that eventually transformed our industry.
