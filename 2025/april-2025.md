**Thank You Letter for ADI**

Two years ago, I made one of the boldest decisions of my career—I left a secure role in tech to work on myself and further my education. It meant stepping into the unknown, in a different country and a precarious job market—uncertain but hopeful. Although I bid goodbye to a few colleagues, I’ve long felt that my farewell letter had fallen short to eagerly convey the gratitude I felt. Two years later, I’ve finally mustered the courage to share it.

To Analog Devices, Inc.—thank you. I truly am grateful for the formative five years of my career. Thank you for taking a chance on me during one of your University Caravans in the Philippines and for selecting me as one of your Academe Linkage Scholars. Never would I have known that it would shape me in the way I am now—always thinking strategically, open to diverse opinions, and excited for the possible future that tech is going to tread.

It has been an honour to work alongside some of the brightest engineers in Silicon Valley and beyond, leading the electronics industry by the reins. I've witnessed firsthand how they navigate complex decisions and breathe life into visionary ideas—innovations that eventually transformed our industry. It has been a privilege to call some of you my teammates and mentors.

> <sup>1</sup> Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. <sup>2</sup> It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before.

> **Judges 3:1-2 ESV**

God prepares and equips His people by making them go through trials, tests, and tribulations. Oftentimes, He uses the consequences of their disobedience to shape them and make them grow for their own good. It doesn't mean that His favour is not with them; on the contrary, it is where His grace abounds more. Through this, He helps His children face their giants and instills in them a "victorious warrior" mindset, one that is rooted in humility, love, and obedience to God—His unchanging character and in Him as a "person."

To be honest, I am a bit lost after finishing my master's degree...

I don't know what to do. Should I look for a job in my previous career as an engineer, or should I find one in project management, the degree I recently finished, and start a career anew from scratch?

It took a lot of back and forth with God, consultation with my husband, and internally processing everything. To my despair, I also shared it with my small group (Connect Group) leader, who empathised with me. He caught the nuances in the way I speak, such as "If God wills," "I hope He gives it to me," and so on and so forth. He gave me a metaphor about God's favor and grace as an unlimited credit card — it's either God will give it to you right away, or He will give it, but in His own time; we will not know when, but it will come. He gave this under the premise that whatever you desire first came from God, and He gave it to you to "water" with prayers.

I was initially cautious in receiving what he imparted to me. After all, this teaching can easily be used in New Age beliefs where "manifestation" of whatever you want is the key — and I don't want any of it. New Age's "manifestation" erases God from the picture, claiming power all to themselves. This is the total opposite of what I want. I want what God wants for me, and that is the very reason why I am careful in becoming so sure about getting something. I always leave it at the throne of God in prayer and give Him the power and permission over my life. All of this is noble and admirable, until someone peeks into my inner world...

The idea of meritocracy was once etched in my mind, believing that if I do everything correctly and by the rules, I will be rewarded. It led me to anchor my identity in what I know, in my knowledge and intellect. If I was not the smartest in the room, I felt uncomfortable and uneasy. That went on for years until God brought me down into one of my valley seasons and uprooted my identity from being the most knowledgeable one, erasing my pride and smugness. I was extremely humbled, for lack of a better term.

He then mightily connected my identity to the finished work of Christ — I do not have to do anything, but just receive the free gift that He offers for all: salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. Like a baby, He moulded me, guided my paths, and sent people from the church to help me during this season until I could "walk" in His presence, and not "crawl." It was the first time that I felt free; I do not have the burden to be all-knowing (because I am not). I can now rest in the fact that I am deeply loved and accepted even if I was still in my mama's womb, and my own mama did not know of my existence yet.

It is here that it was only God who loved me, who took His time to fashion me delicately and intricately, crafting my innards to support me in living this good life He has planned for me. He was the only one who rejoiced in my small milestones inside the womb and never took His loving eyes off me since. This is the very reason why God delays some of my prayers — because He wants to make sure to take all the remnants of the roots of my previous identity and water the new one I have in Christ, trusting in Him completely.

Behind the closed walls of our room, I still sometimes think that I had to do something in order for my prayer to be answered by God. Not until I came across Caleb's life in the Bible.

Caleb was one of the twelve spies Moses sent out to scout the land of Canaan. Upon coming back, they brought back a large cluster of grapes—so large that they had two men carry it on a pole. The other ten acknowledged that the land was as God promised them: "a land flowing with milk and honey." However, fear got the best of them after they saw the inhabitants of the land. "They are so big that we look as if we were grasshoppers in their presence!" Their report spread throughout the whole congregation until all of them were paralysed with fear.

But not Caleb and Joshua; Caleb encouraged the people, "Let us go up at once and take possession of it; for we will certainly conquer it," but to no avail. The people were so gripped by fear that in anger, they complained to Moses and Aaron, saying they were far better off in Egypt, even if they were slaves. At least they still had food to eat, and they were safe and comfortable. This led Moses and Aaron to fall flat on their faces in front of the congregation, and for Joshua and Caleb to tear their clothes out of grief while uttering these words:

> <sup>7</sup> ... The land through which we passed as spies is an exceedingly good land. <sup>8</sup> If the Lord delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey. <sup>9</sup> Only do not rebel against the Lord; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the Lord is with us. Do not fear them.
>
> **Numbers 14:7-9 AMP**

How did the children of Israel respond? Not well: they wanted to throw stones at Caleb and Joshua to kill them! They held the lie that was shared with them and their fear in high regard, venerating them higher than the gift and promises of God, which clouded their conscience, making them act out of their right minds! Seeing the chaos, God intervened and rescued the lives of Caleb and Joshua by letting His glory and brilliance appear in front of the Tabernacle.

Going through the tales of the Israelites, God rewarded Caleb with the very land they spied on as his possession because of how he stood strong on God's promise and character, putting his trust in God wholeheartedly. Among the generation of men who left Egypt, only Caleb (aside from Joshua, who eventually became the leader of Israel) was left alive and strong to inhabit his inheritance. What a noble and admirable man of God!

What did I learn from Caleb's life, and how does it connect to mine? I noticed something in Caleb as he responded to the whole Israelite congregation: he magnified the LORD and His character, not highlighting the skills he personally lacked. Oftentimes, in the face of tests, I would spiral down in enumerating the things that I don't have and my flaws that would render me disqualified from receiving God's gifts. This was also pointed out by my small group (Connect Group) leader, who shared that we people usually have a hard time receiving what God has offered us. We think we have to earn it, and in return, we must give something back to the person who has given it to us—and in this case, it is God. Doing so would nullify what Jesus has done on the cross.

If we truly believe that Jesus has already done it all, then why do we still act like we have to do something for Him in return? The short answer, but it stings: pride and ego. These are also the very same things that hinder us from receiving His grace and mercy.

In my years of living on this earth, I know for a fact that it is hard to receive a gift from someone whom you do not trust. Whether it be a simple compliment, a material gift, or a promise, letting your guard down to receive from an initially deemed untrustworthy person is a no-go. You will only fully trust a person after you have gotten to know them better, and through testing their character multiple times will they be proven unyieldingly good and trustworthy. Without spending time with the other, you will not get to know them deeply. Consequently, if you do not know the person deeply, you will, for a fact, not trust them either. (Well, please take this with a grain of salt; I may have a codependency issue. 🤷🏻‍♀️)

That is exactly what is happening to me. I know God; I have known Jesus since I was a kid, but it was not until my collegiate years that I had a personal relationship with Him, and only when I started working was I baptized by the Holy Spirit and fully surrendered my life to Christ. I have taken multiple steps of faith already, but this takes the cake. This season that I am in is uncharted for me: I have not passed this way before; I have not found myself lost in which career path to take, and I got rejected by the companies that I applied to because I either do not have a Permanent Visa or there is someone much more suited and skilled than I am. This put a lot of toll on my soul, and I ended up crying to God.

I figured that maybe I do not know how to receive God's grace and "inheritance," and that is why I am experiencing this. I reached out once again to my small group leader to impart to me how to practically receive them. However, God met and answered me first...

It was the 30th of March, Sunday, when my husband and I decided to go to church after his driving lesson. I still insisted on going even if I had a debilitating migraine on the front left part of my brain. After a quick trip to Taco Bell, I felt a little bit better, and off we went to church.

During the service, it was as if the Holy Spirit spoke to me directly through the pastor (Darren Kitto). He said (non-verbatim):

<p style="text-align:center"><i> God invites you to take another step of faith. The very same faith that brought you here will bring you to the other side. God says you already know what to do, what the steps are; you've been there... It's just part of life; God has something more for your life, keep on taking those steps of faith. </i></p>

Hearing this made my tears stream down my face uncontrollably. My spirit has been healed; the burden and chains have been lifted. God invites me to trust in Him, His character, and who He really is—not through the clichés the world throws into proverbs: "God helps those who help themselves"—nuh-uh, that isn't in the Bible. God does not uphold meritocracy; He upholds love, trust, obedience, mercy, and justice. Like Caleb, God invites me not to magnify my flaws and lack of skills but to focus on His qualities, for He qualifies and equips the called. He sometimes even uses our mistakes as avenues for our growth. <sup>b</sup>

Through this, I validated that I am now in-between seasons and in the process of transitioning from one to the other. A lot of things made sense to me; I am eager to finish strong and do this transition with God. I have been heeding His prompts for the things I have to do to move into the other season while flourishingly finishing the other. He alleviated my anxiety by helping me see my season in the grand scheme of things, magnifying His good works in my life, learning and leaning more into His character and not my own works, and assuring me that He is already in my tomorrow, waiting for me to step out in faith to Him.

I now picture Him smiling on the other side, full of love and joy, extending His hand to mine.

(continuation of Thank You Letter for ADI)

Among the projects I was involved in, working on the early stages of testing automation is one I hold especially dear. It stretched me as a professional, as I had to study and research ways to make things work given the unique situation our team was in.

What made it even more exciting was the team’s eagerness to share ideas, discuss system architecture, and remain open to whatever challenges might arise—far more thrilling than any lab activity at university! We all took turns presenting the product to different audiences, while the rest of the team provided support with whatever information the speaker needed.

Whether we were working across continents or just across the room, our team got the job done. Through this, I learned how to recognise each team member’s strengths and weaknesses—how to leverage those strengths for the team’s benefit, and support each other where needed.

It’s true what they say: “Teamwork makes the dream work."

To my mentors—whether you knew it or not—thank you for lending me your ears and your time. Beyond the technical knowledge you imparted, I learned how to approach learning itself: continuously, strategically, and with purpose. These thought processes—these habits of mind—are shaped only through repeated exposure to discomfort and the unknown, and choosing to do the “thing” anyway.

I believe anyone can learn anything through sheer effort and determination, although it takes time. But through your mentorship and advice, even a novice like me was able to soar with flying colours. Success is never achieved alone; sometimes, it takes standing on the shoulders of giants.

Though I’ve moved on geographically, ADI will always be a part of my story. I carry the lessons with me and remain a proud alum. I’d also like to extend my congratulations to ADI on its 60th year as a forerunner in technology. Wishing the company continued success and innovation in the years ahead.

Thank you again—for everything.

**"You may now kiss the bride!"**

My dearest Cassidy,

This is it—it’s time. The day you once thought would never come has finally arrived.

I clearly remember the days when we would sit along the Centennial Walkway, watching the sun set over the Big Field. We would usually braid each other's hair, prick each other's pimples, or just wonder where we should eat dinner. Our conversations would typically cross the line of how our day went, what the latest "verbal" teas were, a number of deep philosophical questions that were podcast-worthy (and they still are), and hard-to-answer questions such as why you didn’t have a boyfriend yet. That question would haunt you for years, and for years, we wouldn’t know the answer.

We grew close together. After our uni days, we both shared our first company. We’d go on dates on Monday evenings—either to have our nails or hair done at a salon in SM Dasmariñas, watch a movie, and then eat at a restaurant that stayed open late. As if that wasn’t enough, we would routinely go to each other’s cubes at work if our shifts aligned, and we would take lunch together or talk over afternoon coffee.

One time, I saw you brokenhearted and broken like never before, as if you had run out of chances at life. With a dejected face, you said, “Tati, sa point na ’to, okay na lang sakin mag-adopt, or kumuha ng sperm donor. Kahit anak na lang, okay na sakin.”

We both know you wanted more than that. What an ache it would have been had you not waited a few more months.

Thank God you did.

Then came Lanz. He was something—he was different. He was a breath of fresh air.

You are more than just a friend—you are my sister from another mother. What hurts you, hurts me too; and what makes you glad fills my heart as well. I have seen how much Lanz has added to your life, and how colorful you’ve made his. Yours is a match made in heaven, and it can be attested by the amount of peace surrounding both of you. Your life had been bitter and hard, but these past years—though not devoid of hardships—I know for a fact that both of you cultivated a life full of love, trust, and joy.

You will be called blessed, just like Naomi’s Ruth, for you had been faithful until your Boaz came. May you be blessed among women, and may your future kids know what an able, resilient, strong, fun, and quick-witted woman their mom is. And I hope and pray they will take after you.

Although some would say that your love story has been a whirlwind, I would argue that it’s a God-ordained one—and one for the books. Yours is a testimony of how God orchestrates someone’s love story, making everything happen all in the right time. It has never ceased to amaze me, and I find it encouraging that I share your testimony with my newfound single friends, saying that God still redeems and makes miracles happen—even up to this present day.

**Lanz,**

I have never seen her bloom the way she bloomed when she started seeing you. Yes, bloom she did—she always donned that smile, the one that you know came from the depths of her heart—so serene and pure. You gave her the security she hadn’t felt for quite some time. See, before you came and swept her off her feet, she was always up on her toes…

Lanz, huwag sana lumaki ulo mo sa sasabihin ko, pero you are the answer to her decades-long prayers. Thank you for taking care of her—she can finally breathe. Thank you for loving her unconditionally, as she should be loved. She was always the one who gave, and it’s high time for her to receive love. I am sure she has guarded her heart all these years, safe-keeping her love for her “future” husband. Now, she has a lifetime to pour it all on you and your future family. Her prayers have been answered—please continue to be the Boaz to her Ruth.

**My dearest Cassey,**

I may not be there, but I hope you can feel my love and joy for you through the screen. May it overflow to you in the form of a bouquet—just like three years ago, on that fateful day of March 18, at the courthouse in Trece Martires. May you continue to bloom just like these flowers, and may you have your happily ever after.

Forgive my physical absence on this important milestone, but wherever we are in the world, I will continue to rejoice, mourn, and celebrate with you in everything.

I love you.
