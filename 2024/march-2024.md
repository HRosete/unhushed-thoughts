Well, hello there! It's been a while. 😊 A lot has changed. I, for one, am in a different country and continent now for a year and a month already! Wow, who would have thought that I would be living outside my home country. Haha! Never in my wildest dreams, but hey, you don't know where God will take you if you surrender your life to Him, eh? To think that I was so scared of surrendering every single thing to Him before because I thought "anything can happen 😢" (read it with an overwhelmingly anxious voice). But now, here I am, I have fully surrendered everything to Jesus - my future, my career... everything! With my whole life in the palm of His hands, I can now confidently say "anything can happen 🍃" with an anxiety-free, hopeful tone.

How about you, how are you? How have things been? I hope they're looking up. 😊 Forgive me if I keep on talking, it's my blog anyway. Haha! 😁 I wish I can go on and on here, but I have things to do, places to be, and promises to keep. See you around then! 👋🏻

Perhaps this is because of Pride and Prejudice, but I am quite inspired to lay my thoughts down at this moment. First of all, why haven't I read classics before?! Surely they were classics for a reason, but yet, I never expected them to be this good! Take Pride and Prejudice for example. I hadn't intended to read it last night -- though I was very happy to know that I didn't have to download Kindle on my new phone since it has the "Books" app. I have downloaded Kindle, of course, because I want to sync the books that I had on my previous phone to the new one. Anyways, in the Apple Books app, there are a number of free classic books they recommend people to read, 51 of them to be exact, and some have accompanying audiobooks. I first gave "The Great Gatsby" a try -- honestly, I downloaded this because I heard from the YouTuber Haley Pham that this is one of the books Taylor Swift recommends. To my delight, it has an accompanying audiobook with it. I listened to it for a couple of minutes until I realized, I do not fancy taking on another action story after watching the great "Argylle" movie by Matthew Vaughn a couple of hours ago. My mind has been tickled enough by it already and is so stimulated to entertain another one. I fumbled my fingers across Pride and Prejudice. I've heard a lot about this, saw some Reels about this, that they seem ample reason enough for me to pay this book my attention. I pressed Play on the audiobook, laid down on my bed, and listened to the whimsical tunes of the introductory orchestra that gave me the "Bridgerton" vibes. Oh, the spot in my heart that I have for period dramas! My heart fluttered as I listened on towards the foreword. I slept and decided that I would give it a go in the morning right after waking up.

I bid goodbye to my darling as he went off to work and snoozed some more. I then rolled out of bed to make some coffee, heated the bagel, cut it in half, and spread cream cheese on top of it. I pressed play on the Pride and Prejudice audiobook. Wow -- just, wow! Not minding the time -- even if I should have -- I've listened to and read five chapters of it while eating. Then it dawned on me that I have been missing out so much on literature! I should have read this years ago! I should have read this before Stephanie Meyer's Twilight Series, Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher Series, and Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson Series (all 10 books of them!)! This is so well-written and her literary style takes me back to a period I haven't been before, making me feel at home and intrigued at the same time. Oh for sure, this ensures that I will read classic literature for quite a while...
